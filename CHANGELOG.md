## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- **Oracle dialect lineage** — full Oracle dialect support in the analyzer and lineage extractors, surfacing Oracle-specific pseudocolumns (`ROWID`, `ROWNUM`, `LEVEL`, `SYSDATE`, etc.) and DML write targets for `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE`
- **SQL `COMMENT` descriptions on nodes** — inline and trailing SQL comments on table/column definitions are surfaced as node descriptions for display in downstream UIs
- **`name_spans` and `body_span` on Node** ([#30](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/30)) — each node now carries the source spans of every occurrence of its name plus the span of its defining body, enabling graph↔text navigation in editors
- **Flattened `AnalyzeResult`** ([#19](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/19), [#33](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/pull/33)) — `nodes` and `edges` are now top-level fields on `AnalyzeResult` instead of nested under `graph`, simplifying consumer code. **Breaking change** for consumers that accessed `result.graph.nodes` / `result.graph.edges`.

#### Export (flowscope-export)
- **Dali-compatible output layer** — new `--format dali` export target for Dali lineage interop, with ownership-only DML target detection, source-expression-preserving column refs, and defensive backward-traversal caps on large graphs

#### CLI (flowscope-cli)
- `--format dali` export support; requires SQL input and returns contextual export errors instead of silently emitting empty packages or panicking on JSON serialization failures

#### Web App (app/) & VS Code extension
- **SQL IntelliSense in the editor** ([#26](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/26)) — context-aware completions (tables, columns, keywords, functions) in `SqlView` backed by the flowscope engine, with Tab-accept behavior that beats CodeMirror's `indentWithTab` binding
- **VS Code `CompletionItemProvider`** ([#26](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/26)) — the VS Code extension now delivers the same flowscope-backed SQL completions inside VS Code
- **Text→graph navigation** ([#24](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/24)) — clicking in the SQL editor reveals the corresponding lineage node in the graph
- **Graph→text navigation** ([#31](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/31)) — clicking a graph node cycles through its occurrences in the SQL editor
- **Stale-graph banner + Run-button rename** ([#21](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/21), [#22](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/22)) — the graph surfaces a banner when its data has drifted from the editor, and the Run button is renamed for clarity

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- **dbt multi-model chains now render as connected lineage** ([#32](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/32)) — a dbt model's bare `SELECT` is materialized as the canonical Table node for the model name instead of a per-statement Output node, so when a downstream file references it via `{{ ref(...) }}` the producer and consumer collapse into a single graph node and multi-hop `A → B → C` pipelines show end-to-end
- **Ephemeral dbt models preserved through CTE hiding** — dbt model sinks are marked with a `dbtModelSink` flag so `hide_ctes` retains ephemeral models in the global graph, and definition occurrences are tracked separately so statement-scoped views surface the producer span before any consumer refs
- **Ambiguous dbt model materialization surfaced** — duplicate model names across files now emit `SCHEMA_CONFLICT` with an unambiguous warning about definition vs. producer semantics
- **dbt CTE and output-node collisions fixed** ([#15](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/15)) — explicit output nodes are included in script-level dependencies and edge IDs are now collision-safe via statement-scope metadata
- **Column-lineage pruning refined** — tighter pruning rules eliminate spurious column edges without dropping legitimate lineage
- **Stale analysis cache invalidated** — the web app's analysis cache sentinel is bumped to `v5` so pre-flatten `AnalyzeResult` entries no longer rehydrate into a slot where `result.nodes` is undefined

#### Web App (app/)
- **Reveal targeting scoped to the active editor** — reveal lookups no longer cross editors in multi-file controlled setups, and reveal clears no longer trigger spurious navigation

### Changed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Graph builders share output-node and edge helpers, reducing duplication between the script-level and statement-level paths
- Span helpers are hardened against UTF-8 panics and relation span lookup is unified

### Tests
- Alias-shadowing coverage added for nested completion scopes

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- **Instance-aware relation tracking** for self-join support — each table occurrence is tracked as a distinct instance, enabling correct lineage through self-joins
- Instance-aware filters, wildcards, and global lineage propagation
- Orphan edge cleanup and alias limits for hardened instance tracking

#### Lineage Graph
- **Join attributes on edges** — join metadata (type, conditions) is now attached to edges rather than nodes, better reflecting the relational model
- Analysis state lifted to Workspace for cross-statement coordination

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Filter predicates attached to wrong table nodes
- Source-less projections missing base table lineage edges
- Join dependency edges not created for aggregate and edge-case queries
- Analyzer lineage regressions in instance-aware subquery column scoping

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Linting disabled by default in web app** — linting was hardcoded as always-on in the analysis worker, causing significant performance degradation on large projects. The "Show Lint Issues" toggle now controls both display and computation, defaulting to off.

### Changed

- Rebuilt WASM artifacts and formatted generated code

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Oracle dialect** support across CLI (`-d oracle`), core engine, and web app UI
- Autofix metadata types, `applyEdits` utility, and lint provenance fields

### Changed

- **Bumped sqlparser from 0.59 to 0.61** — migrates all AST pattern matches to the new tuple-variant API where `Statement`, `TableConstraint`, `ColumnOption`, and `MergeAction` variants now wrap dedicated structs
- Adapted to `ConnectBy` becoming `Vec<ConnectByKind>`, `TableAlias` gaining an `explicit` field, and `TableFactor::Derived` gaining a `sample` field

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-03

### Improved

- Added linter documentation to README files across the monorepo (core, CLI, export crates)
- Aligned npm package versions with Cargo workspace version (was 0.3.1, now 0.4.1)
- Rebuilt WASM artifacts from current Rust source

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

#### SQL Linter Engine (flowscope-core)

### Changed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Unified type system: `CanonicalType` replaces internal `SqlType` enum with broader coverage (Time, Binary, Json, Array)
- `OutputColumn.data_type` now populated with inferred types for SELECT expressions
- Type checking now accepts dialect parameter for dialect-specific rules

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- dbt model cross-statement linking with proper case normalization for Snowflake
- DDL-seeded schema preservation (schemas no longer overwritten by later queries)
- UTF-8 safety in `should_show_for_cursor` when cursor offset is mid-character

### Known Limitations

#### Type Inference
- **Schema-unaware type checking**: TYPE_MISMATCH warnings only detect mismatches between literals, CASTs, and known function return types. Column type mismatches (e.g., `WHERE users.id = users.email` where `id` is INTEGER and `email` is TEXT) are not detected because expression type inference does not yet resolve column types from schema metadata.
- **No expression spans**: TYPE_MISMATCH warnings include the statement index but not precise source spans for editor integration. This is because sqlparser's expression AST nodes don't include span information by default.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Highlights
- First public release of the FlowScope Rust + WASM + TypeScript stack
- Multi-dialect SQL parsing with table/column lineage, schema validation, and editor-friendly spans
- Export tooling for Mermaid, JSON, HTML, CSV bundles, and XLSX across Rust and WASM
- React components + CLI for lineage visualization and data export workflows
- CTE and derived table definitions now include spans for editor navigation
- Export downloads in React normalize byte buffers for reliable Blob creation

### Changed

#### WASM Module (flowscope-wasm)
- **Breaking**: Changed error code from `REQUEST_PARSE_ERROR` to `INVALID_REQUEST` for JSON parse/validation errors in `analyze_sql_json()`. Consumers matching on the old error code should update their error handling.

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Fixed potential panic in `extract_qualifier` when cursor offset lands on invalid UTF-8 boundary
- Fixed early-return bug in completion logic that incorrectly suppressed completions when schema metadata lacked column info but query context (CTEs/subqueries) had valid columns
- Fixed potential integer overflow in completion item scoring by using saturating arithmetic
- Added spans for CTE and derived table definition nodes to support editor navigation

#### Exporter (flowscope-export)
- Bundle reserved keyword list inside the crate for publish-time builds

#### React Package (@pondpilot/flowscope-react)
- Fixed ZIP/XLSX downloads by normalizing export byte buffers for Blob creation

### Improved

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Added named constants for completion scoring values to improve code maintainability
- Added `Debug` derive to `QualifierResolution` for easier debugging
