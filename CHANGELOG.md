# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- **dbt multi-model chains now render as connected lineage** ([#32](https://github.com/pondpilot/flowscope/issues/32)) — a dbt model's bare SELECT is materialized as the canonical Table node for the model name instead of a per-statement Output node, so when a downstream file references it via `{{ ref(...) }}` the producer and consumer collapse into a single graph node and multi-hop `A -> B -> C` pipelines show end-to-end.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- **Instance-aware relation tracking** for self-join support — each table occurrence is tracked as a distinct instance, enabling correct lineage through self-joins
- Instance-aware filters, wildcards, and global lineage propagation
- Orphan edge cleanup and alias limits for hardened instance tracking

#### Lineage Graph
- **Join attributes on edges** — join metadata (type, conditions) is now attached to edges rather than nodes, better reflecting the relational model
- Analysis state lifted to Workspace for cross-statement coordination

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Filter predicates attached to wrong table nodes
- Source-less projections missing base table lineage edges
- Join dependency edges not created for aggregate and edge-case queries
- Analyzer lineage regressions in instance-aware subquery column scoping

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

- **Linting disabled by default in web app** — linting was hardcoded as always-on in the analysis worker, causing significant performance degradation on large projects. The "Show Lint Issues" toggle now controls both display and computation, defaulting to off.

### Changed

- Rebuilt WASM artifacts and formatted generated code

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **Oracle dialect** support across CLI (`-d oracle`), core engine, and web app UI
- Autofix metadata types, `applyEdits` utility, and lint provenance fields

### Changed

- **Bumped sqlparser from 0.59 to 0.61** — migrates all AST pattern matches to the new tuple-variant API where `Statement`, `TableConstraint`, `ColumnOption`, and `MergeAction` variants now wrap dedicated structs
- Adapted to `ConnectBy` becoming `Vec<ConnectByKind>`, `TableAlias` gaining an `explicit` field, and `TableFactor::Derived` gaining a `sample` field

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-03

### Improved

- Added linter documentation to README files across the monorepo (core, CLI, export crates)
- Aligned npm package versions with Cargo workspace version (was 0.3.1, now 0.4.1)
- Rebuilt WASM artifacts from current Rust source

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Type inference for SQL expressions with comprehensive type checking
- New `TYPE_MISMATCH` warning code for detecting incompatible type comparisons and operations
- Schema-aware column type lookup - column references now resolve types from provided schema metadata
- CTE column type propagation to outer queries
- Dialect-aware type compatibility rules (e.g., Boolean/Integer comparison allowed in MySQL but not PostgreSQL)
- NULL comparison anti-pattern detection (`= NULL` warns to use `IS NULL` instead)

#### Completion API

#### React Package (@pondpilot/flowscope-react)
- Web workers for graph/matrix/layout computations (improved UI responsiveness)
- LayoutProgressIndicator component for visual layout feedback
- Debug flags (GRAPH_DEBUG, LAYOUT_DEBUG) for performance diagnostics

#### Web App (app/)

### Changed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Unified type system: `CanonicalType` replaces internal `SqlType` enum with broader coverage (Time, Binary, Json, Array)
- `OutputColumn.data_type` now populated with inferred types for SELECT expressions
- Type checking now accepts dialect parameter for dialect-specific rules

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- dbt model cross-statement linking with proper case normalization for Snowflake
- DDL-seeded schema preservation (schemas no longer overwritten by later queries)
- UTF-8 safety in `should_show_for_cursor` when cursor offset is mid-character

### Known Limitations

#### Type Inference
- **Schema-unaware type checking**: TYPE_MISMATCH warnings only detect mismatches between literals, CASTs, and known function return types. Column type mismatches (e.g., `WHERE users.id = users.email` where `id` is INTEGER and `email` is TEXT) are not detected because expression type inference does not yet resolve column types from schema metadata.
- **No expression spans**: TYPE_MISMATCH warnings include the statement index but not precise source spans for editor integration. This is because sqlparser's expression AST nodes don't include span information by default.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Highlights
- First public release of the FlowScope Rust + WASM + TypeScript stack
- Multi-dialect SQL parsing with table/column lineage, schema validation, and editor-friendly spans
- Export tooling for Mermaid, JSON, HTML, CSV bundles, and XLSX across Rust and WASM
- React components + CLI for lineage visualization and data export workflows
- CTE and derived table definitions now include spans for editor navigation
- Export downloads in React normalize byte buffers for reliable Blob creation

### Changed

#### WASM Module (flowscope-wasm)
- **Breaking**: Changed error code from `REQUEST_PARSE_ERROR` to `INVALID_REQUEST` for JSON parse/validation errors in `analyze_sql_json()`. Consumers matching on the old error code should update their error handling.

### Fixed

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Fixed potential panic in `extract_qualifier` when cursor offset lands on invalid UTF-8 boundary
- Fixed early-return bug in completion logic that incorrectly suppressed completions when schema metadata lacked column info but query context (CTEs/subqueries) had valid columns
- Fixed potential integer overflow in completion item scoring by using saturating arithmetic
- Added spans for CTE and derived table definition nodes to support editor navigation

#### Exporter (flowscope-export)
- Bundle reserved keyword list inside the crate for publish-time builds

#### React Package (@pondpilot/flowscope-react)
- Fixed ZIP/XLSX downloads by normalizing export byte buffers for Blob creation

### Improved

#### Core Engine (flowscope-core)
- Added named constants for completion scoring values to improve code maintainability
- Added `Debug` derive to `QualifierResolution` for easier debugging
- Added comprehensive unit tests for string helper functions (`extract_last_identifier`, `extract_qualifier`) and qualifier resolution logic
